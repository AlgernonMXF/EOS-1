Sex-toy entrepreneur Polly Rodriguez is sick of bankers giving her funny looks.Her online shop, Unbound, sells candy-colored vibrators, bangle handcuffs and other intimate products for women. Despite selling out inventory, Rodriguez said she struggled to find a bank that would extend her a small-business loan. She chalked it up to finance industry jitters when it comes to sex.

成人玩具企业家波莉·罗德里格斯对银行家的搞笑模样感到厌恶。她的网上商店Unbound销售糖果色振动器，手铐手铐和其他女性亲密产品。尽管库存被销售出去，罗德里格斯说，她努力寻找一家银行给她的小企业贷款。但当谈到性问题时，金融行业总是比较敏感。

Now she sees a ray of hope coming from digital currency.

现在她看到来自数字货币的一线希望。

“When you get labeled as an adult company, you get blacklisted, effectively,” Rodriguez said. “The moment you put it into code and take out the subjective moral judgment, it’s a shift.”

“当你被标记为成人公司时，你会被立刻列入黑名单，”罗德里格斯说。 “当你把它写入代码并拿出主观的道德判断时，这是一个转变。”

Banks and credit-card companies can be hidebound when it comes to adult businesses, which can be big moneymakers. Sex toys alone haul in more than $20 billion a year around the world, and by 2020, sales are expected to reach almost $30 billion, according to London-based market-research firm Technavio. Still, financial firms consider sex-toy sellers high risk, lumping them in with businesses such as escort services and pornography websites, which can sometimes flirt with illegality.

尽管成人玩具公司可以有丰厚的市场回报，但银行和信用卡公司依然非常守旧。根据伦敦市场研究公司Technavio的数据，单是成人玩具在全球的年销售就超过200亿美元，到2020年，销售额预计将达到近300亿美元。尽管如此，金融公司依然认为成人玩具卖家存在高风险，将他们与诸如陪护服务和色情网站等业务混为一谈，这些业务有时可能会有非法行为。

Chargeback Wariness 退款谨慎
Credit-card companies are also wary of chargebacks, which happen when a cardholder claims a transaction is fraudulent. For instance, a man charges his porn-watching to his card, then denies he was doing it when his wife discovers the payment, leaving the card company to eat the money.

信用卡公司也对退款持谨慎态度，当持卡人声称交易具有欺诈性时会发生退款。 例如，一名男子用信用卡观看色情片，然后当他的妻子发现付款时，他否认正在做这件事，让信用卡公司承担这些钱。

Freedom from such complications has some adult companies cheering the swell of digital currencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the rise of digital-payment tokens, which could help them skirt skeptical intermediaries and allow customers to make direct payments.

一些成年公司从数字货币中找到了避免这种复杂情况的发生，并为数字货币市场的膨胀（包括比特币和以太坊）以及数字代币付款的兴起助一臂之力。这些方式可以帮助他们避开怀疑的中间商并允许客户直接付款。

Xavi Clos, head of production at BaDoink VR, a virtual-reality porn-production company, said that tokens show big potential in the adult industry because they’re anonymous and direct ways to accept payment. The problem, he said, is “for actual commercial use, there’s nothing that’s ready for prime time yet.” Transaction costs are still too high, and the infrastructure, subject to hacks and freezes, must improve first.

哈维克洛斯是虚拟现实色情制作公司BaDoink VR的制作人，他表示代币在成人行业显示出巨大的潜力，因为他们是匿名的，并且可以直接接受付款的方式。他说这个问题，对于实际商业用途而言，没有什么可以在黄金时间准备就绪的。目前交易成本依然过高，且基础设施在受到黑客攻击和冻结前必须先完善起来。

Cottage Industry 家庭手工作坊行业
That’s not for a lack of trying. A cottage industry of digital-payment mechanisms for sex-focused businesses is emerging. One early entrant, SpankChain, is setting up a payment ecosystem based on the Ethereum blockchain. In a white paper, authored by “Spanktoshi Nakabooty” — a reference to Bitcoin’s anonymous creator with the nom de guerre Satoshi Nakamoto — SpankChain explains how the tokens can be used as payment tools for webcams. The virtual payment arrangement will differentiate itself by charging a 5 percent fee on performer earnings, compared with the 30 percent to 50 percent charged by traditional cam services, according to the Nakabooty white paper.

这不是因为缺乏尝试。以性为中心的数字支付机制在家庭手工行业正在兴起。一个早期的进入者SpankChain正在建立一个基于以太坊区块链的支付生态系统。在一篇由“Spanktoshi Nakabooty”撰写的白皮书中 - 对比特币的匿名创建者中本聪的引用 - SpankChain解释了代币如何被用作网络摄像头的支付工具。根据Nakabooty的白皮书，虚拟支付安排将通过收取表演者收入5％，而传统摄像服务收取30％至50％的费用。

Such tokens would revolutionize webcams, which allow performers to stream live shows while users reward them with virtual tips. Payment-processing costs currently chew up a lot of their earnings. This year, Chief Executive Officer Ameen Soleimani said SpankChain would promote its own webcam site as a demonstration project. Porn actress Giselle Palmer starred in its first live-cam show on New Year’s Day.

这样的代币将彻底改变网络直播，允许用户可以通过虚拟小费来奖励现场表演。目前付款成本的占据了他们很多的收入。今年，首席执行官Ameen Soleimani表示SpankChain将宣传自己的网络直播作为示范项目。新年的第一天，色情女演员吉赛尔·帕尔默出演了的第一场网络直播show。

Australian Accent 澳洲方面
Another coin for the adult-entertainment industry, called Intimate, aims to cater to webcam businesses but also extend to businesses including sex-toy retailers, short-stay hotels and escort services in countries where they’re legal.

另一个叫做Intimate的代币也是为成人娱乐行业服务的，旨在满足网络直播业务的需求，同时也扩展到包括性玩具零售商，短期住宿酒店和护送服务等合法的业务。

Intimate founder Reuben Coppa spread the word about Intimate’s initial coin offering at a cryptocurrency conference in New York in November. Coppa wore a T-shirt bearing the company’s logo, which resembles a stylized thong.

Intimate的创始人Reuben Coppa在11月份的纽约加密货币会议上发布了关于Intimate最初投币产品的消息。 Coppa穿着一件带有公司标志的T恤，类似于一个特色化的丁字裤。

Coppa, an Australian who speaks a mile a minute, zigzagged from talk of the ICO to other projects that will go with the payment mechanism. The company is developing something called Intimate Reputation, a blockchain-enabled rating system that allows escorts to know more about their customers before meeting them in person.

澳大利亚人Coppa在一个节目中说到，说起ICO和其他支付机制的项目发展都是曲折的。该公司正在开发一种名为“亲密信誉”，这是一款支持区块链的评级系统，可以在双方见面前了解更多有关其客户的信息。

“Right now, what they rely on is phone calls and the tone of text messages” to determine whether an interaction with a client will be safe, Coppa said. “By applying something like an Uber or Airbnb rating, they could make behavior better.”

“现在，他们依靠的是电话和短信的语气”来确定与客户的互动是否安全，Coppa说。 “通过像Uber或Airbnb这样的评分应用，他们可以也有更好的行为。”

ICO Leeriness  ICO猜疑
Companies like SpankChain and Intimate face an uphill climb with regulators already leery of ICOs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned investors last year that they are likely hotbeds of fraud and created a cyber division that will focus in part on violations. The unit comes as ICOs raked in more than $2 billion in capital last year, according to analysts at Autonomous Research LLC in New York. Companies are also betting that users will eventually get comfortable paying with virtual currency, which is far from certain.

像SpankChain和Intimate这样的公司面临着对已经对ICO持怀疑态度的监管机构。去年美国证券交易委员会警告投资者，这些公司可能是欺诈的温床，并设立了一个网络部门，将部分重点放在监管违规行为上。据纽约Autonomous Research LLC的分析师称，去年的ICO收入超过20亿美元。各家公司也在赌博，用户最终会习惯于使用虚拟货币付款，但这还远远没有确定。

The marriage between the sex business and crypto-payments would be impossible without the squeamishness of traditional bankers about the sex business. The banks’ opposition could change once they see how much money they stand to lose to virtual-currency companies, said sex-toy seller Rodriguez.

如果没有传统银行家对性生意的偏见，性生意和数字加密支付之间的联姻就不可能实现。成人玩具销售商罗德里格斯说，银行的反对意见会改变，一旦看到他们有多少钱会被虚拟货币公司抢走，这些银行的反对意见将会改变。

If cryptocurrencies and digital tokens came into widespread use in the adult industry, she said, “then I don’t have to spend so much time worrying, ‘Is my bank account going to get shut down?’ Because we’re so unwilling to have conversations about sexual health and wellness in a way that’s healthy and good, we end up relegating this industry to the shadows. And that’s not good for anybody.”

如果加密货币和数字代币在成人行业中广泛使用，她说：“那么我不必花太多时间担心我的银行账户会关闭吗？” 因为我们如此不情愿用健康和体面的方式进行关于性健康的交流，我们最终会将这个行业推向了阴影。这对任何人都是不利的。
