目前EOS的节点投票，采用的是持币人按持币数量投票的机制。

The current BP voting is based on a mechanism by which BP is determined by the EOS holders and their amountof EOS.

这样的投票机制，很容易导致卡尔特垄断联盟，即持仓大户通过相互投票可以保证自己一直做节点，从而形成垄断。

Such voting mechanism would easily lead to a cartel, where large holders of large holdings would vote on each other to ensure that they can always be  BP, therefore creating a monopoly.

节点形成垄断联盟，会伤害系统的开放性，阻碍EOS的发展，同时也一直为外界所诟病，详见V神文章...。

The formation of a monopoly alliance, which can harm the openness of EOS community and hinder the development of EOS, and It has also ofen been criticized by many people, see also... .

现在，社区正在对这个问题的解决方案展开热烈的讨论。

Now, the community is having a hot discussion about the solution to this problem.

但讨论的内容大都围绕制定宪法展开，倡导公开透明，独立运行，以阻止垄断联盟的产生。

Much of the discussion is focus on  building a constitution that advocates transparency and independence to prevent cartels.

围绕宪法的解决方案，在实际操作性上会面临较大考验。

But the solution based on  constitution will face much great challenge in practice.

在这里，我们提出一个EOS投票机制的改进建议：

在节点选择机制中，依据DAPP锁定的EOS数量决定谁做节点。

Here, we propose an improvement suggustion for the EOS voting mechanism:

voting based on Dapps and the amout of EOS Locked.

理由如下：

following is the reasons:

1、DAPP是EOS真正的价值生产者。EOS经济模型的核心，就是通过DAPP的EOS锁定带来EOS价格的上涨，从而回报EOS的投资人。DAPP锁定的EOS越多，EOS的价值就越大。

1. DAPP is the real value producer of EOS coin.  According  the EOS economic model, EOS coin represents the compution and network resoure,and EOS price goes up  through EOS coins locked of DAPPs. The more EOS amout the DAPPs  lock, the greater the value of EOS is.

2、一个DAPP需要锁定的EOS数量是开放和动态变化的。DAPP谁都可以做，YAHOO、GOOGLE、FACEBOOK、亚马逊都是从小网站开始长大，长大以后又随时受到新的小网站的挑战。采用DAPP投票，意味着节点的决定权随时能变化，因而避免长期的垄断。

2. Dapps and the amout of EOS they Locked changes dynamicly. Anyone can involve to develop DAPP, and bring it to a big one. YAHOO, GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, amazon are all growing up from small websites, and they are always challenged by new small websites when they grow up. Voting based on DAPP and the EOS their locked means that the Bps can be changed following the growth of Dapps, thus avoiding long-term monopoly.

3、按DAPP锁定的EOS数量决定谁做节点，可以让社区更多的人关注DAPP的建设，从而促进EOS生态圈的良性发展，让更多优秀的DAPP涌现，提升EOS真正价值。

3, Voting on Dapps and EOS amount their locked can let more and more people in the community to focus on DAPP devolpement, so as to promote  the EOS ecological development of circle, and to help more excellent DAPP grows and bring real value to  EOS coin.

4、DAPP是节点的直接用户方，DAPP最有了解节点的运营支撑能力，同时DAPP客观上有动力选择性价比高的节点，以有效地降低自己的锁定成本。

4, DAPPs is the user of BPs, DAPPs  can understand deeply about the operation  ability of BPs. Meanwhile,DAPPs objectively have an incentive to choose BPs that can provide more computing resources with low cost, to minimize their locked EOS amount  to reduce their own costs.

5、DAPP的运行数据，如网络资源的使用情况、交易量等都是公开透明的，一个DAPP很难为做一个节点而作弊。


5. The operation data of DAPP, such as the usage of network resources and trading volume, are transparent can can be checked on the network publicly. It is  difficult to cheating for BP for a DAPP.



6、BM认为最终的出块节点会是EOS上那些最大的应用，详见视频41'47''...。即让最终会是EOS最大的应用，何不直接制定规则，让最大的应用成为节点？



6、In an interview, for answering the question "who can be the BP",BM said  “what you'll probably end up seeing is those who provide the the biggest  applications on the platform “, see in detail 41'47''. So,why we make the rule that  who providing  the the biggest  applications on the platform can be the BPs?



具体的实现方案，可以采用以下的三种方式：



There are three ways to implement the above suggestion:



1、现有节点投票选择机制不变，但投票主体由持币人改为DAPP开发者，投票规则从依据持币人的持币数量，改为DAPP锁定的EOS数量。



1, Keep the existing BP voting process  unchanged, but the voting body is changed from the EOS holder to the DAPP developer, and the voting rule is  changed to the amout of  EOS locked by the DAPPs from  according to the amount of the holder's EOS.



2、节点不用投票，直接从锁定EOS数量最多的DAPP中产生，即锁定EOS数量最多的21个DAPP可以选择做主节点，锁定数量次之的100个DAPP可以选择做备用节点。如果一个DAPP不愿意做节点，则由下一个锁定量的DAPP做节点。



2, cancel the Voting process for BPs, and who can be BPs is detemined by the EOS amout locked by Dapps. That is,  TOP 21 Dapps locking EOS can be 21 BPs directly.  If a DAPP does not want to make be a BP, the next DAPP can take over it.



3、节点与DAPP投资孵化同步考虑，投资孵化DAPP效益最好（以锁定EOS计算）的机构可以选择做节点。目前EOS每年增发5%，1%用于节点，4%用于DAPP孵化。4%的DAPP孵化增发资金使用方法目前尚未确定，但也存在一个资金使用效率的管理问题。锁定EOS多、投资孵化效益好的机构做节点，可以解决节点选择问题，也可以解决投资孵化机构的管理问题，即投资孵化的实际效益用锁定的币来考核。




3,  cancel the Voting process for BPs, and Investors who seeded and incubated the DAPPs which locks the TOP 21 amout of  EOS can be 21 BPs. In this way,  the  the 21 BPs can be choose ,meanwhile the managment efficiency of EOS VC can be measured. That is, the Investors on EOS is measured by the locked amount of EOS by thirs Dapp.



以上三种实现方案都是充分利用了DAPP锁定EOS的数量，这对于EOS的币价的上涨的关键因素。具体哪一种，可以通过社区讨论来确定。



the three above ways are all take advantage of the locked amount of EOS, which is key to the values of EOS. Which one is the best solution ?  May be it can be determined by discuion of the EOS communty.



 其他说明: | some questions:



1、在刚开始的时候，EOS上面的DAPP生态还没有起来，怎么办？  | at the begining, there is few Dapp on EOS,  how to determine who will be BPs?



可以利用现有的投票机制选出节点，在DAPP生态起来以后逐步过渡到用新的节点规则。



The current voting mechanism based on holder's EOS coins  can be used to select the BPs utill   DAPPs ecology grow and there are a lot of Dapps on EOS.



2、为赚取节点奖励，一些人是否会故意开发垃圾DAPP占用网络资源? | Is there some people intentionally develop the garbage( no use ) DAPP on EOS in order to earn the BP reward?



垃圾DAPP没有造血功能，最终会被真正有用的DAPP所替代掉。按照目前的奖励规则，前21个节点获取1%EOS的一半，也就是23万EOS，也就是一个真正有价值的应用只要一年内能有23万的EOS收入，就能对垃圾的DAPP形成挑战。在原本打破现有大户垄断，1000万的EOS，要容易的多。




The garbage  DAPP can not produce EOS income  except BP bonus，there for it will eventually be replaced by the useful DAPP that can produce business income. According to the current rule，21 BPs earn half of 1%  EOS ,i.e. 230000 EOS as there bonus, which means if a real DAPP producs  230000 EOS  business income, it can challenge to the garbage  DAPP. It is much easier than charllenge the  100 million bigholder in the current voting base on coin holder. 



3、让DAPP做节点是否会互相影响，不专心做好各自范围内的工作? | Whether the work of  DAPP and BP will influence each other and not concentrate on  their own work?



DAPP和节点在技术上相关联的，大型DAPP尤其关心节点的可靠运行来，因此不会相互影响。另外，一个DAPP也可以放弃做节点，让其他DAPP做节点。



DAPP and nodes are technically related, and large DAPPs are especially concerned about the reliable operation of BPs, so they do not affect each other. In addition, a DAPP can also give up the right of being the BP.



结论 | conclusion



基于的DAPP及其锁币数量的节点选择机制，比现有的持币人直接投票机制更有利于打破大户卡尔塔联盟，也更符合EOS模型。希望EOS社区能够充分考虑这一投票机制。



for BP eleciton,voting based on Dapps and the amout of EOS Locked is much better than the current coin-holder based voting. It can avoid the whale Karta league and it alse be more consistent with the EOS economic model. hope it will be considered by EOS comunity.
