I originally started this article as a comment on Fred Ehrsam’s similarly themed post. The comment just got too big because I was sipping my way through a large coffee, so I broke it out into its own article. Enjoy!

我最初的这篇文章是对Fred Ehrsam的类似主题文章的评论。这条评论太大了，因为我正在喝一大杯咖啡，所以我把它写进了自己的文章。享受吧!

Many people in the blockchain industry want to see faster progress in R&D with respect to blockchain performance, capacity (scaling), privacy, governance and secure “stable value” tokens. Naturally the question arises as to what funding and team models would best achieve this goal.

区块链行业的许多人都希望在区块链性能、容量(扩展)、隐私、治理和安全“稳定值”令牌方面取得更快的研发进展。自然的问题是，什么样的资金和团队模型最能达到这个目标。

Clearly the problem is not limited to funding. The Ethereum Foundation holds ~$200M in its endowment, and Tezos and EOS have collected even greater funds from public investors in recent ICOs. That is a huge amount of financial ammo that the leaders of these projects can throw at engineering and research work. The interesting question is how such resources can best be directed towards developing blockchain protocols as fast as possible.

显然，问题不限于资金。Ethereum基金会在其捐赠基金中持有2亿美元，Tezos和EOS在最近的ICOs中从公共投资者那里获得了更多的资金。这是大量的金融弹药，这些项目的领导者可以投入到工程和研究工作中。有趣的问题是，这些资源如何能够最好地以最快的速度开发区块链协议。

Fred makes the case that R&D work should be thrown open to the market, with substantial bounties offered to teams that can add functionality such as sharding that would allow blockchain networks to scale-out their capacity (sharding increases capacity by partitioning responsibilities for computation and storage across the network). Tezos plans a similar approach, and explicitly states that it will foster the formation of decentralized teams that compete for chunks of its funds dispersed as bounties. The idea is that competition amongst teams, and having a larger pool of brains working on the core problems and code, will drive faster progress. There must at least be some merit to this thinking.

Fred认为研发工作应该向市场开放，有大量的奖金提供给能够增加功能的团队，比如sharding，可以让区块链网络扩展他们的容量(sharding通过划分网络的计算和存储的责任来增加容量)。Tezos计划采用类似的方法，并明确表示，它将促进分散的团队的形成，而这些分散的团队将会分散成大量的资金。这个想法是，团队之间的竞争，以及在核心问题和代码上拥有更大的大脑池，将推动更快的进展。这种想法至少有一些可取之处。

However in my view there are two major reasons why this approach is not entirely practical: (1) the creation of novel decentralized protocols and cryptography often involves years of thinking and skills that are rare and thus these technologies cannot just be conjured on demand by those wishing to earn bounties, or indeed those who have just run ICOs (2) even though such pieces of fundamental science can often be described in isolation, their introduction into a decentralized network stack often involves far reaching technical changes, making it very difficult for teams to work independently and for critical pieces to be built out incrementally. For example, the implementation of sharding also involves the adoption of a new smart contract programming model (in which contracts communicate using asynchronous message passing) and this involves yet more complex science and engineering.

但是在我看来,这种方法有两个主要的原因是不完全实用:(1)创建小说分权协议和加密通常需要多年的思维和技能,是罕见的,因此这些技术不只是祈求希望获得赏金的人的需求,甚至那些刚刚运行这个理事会(2)即使这样的基础科学中描述通常可以隔离,他们引入一个去中心化的网络栈通常包含深远的技术变化,使它很难独立工作的团队和关键部分是逐步建立起来的。例如，sharding的实现还包括采用一种新的智能契约编程模型(在该模型中使用异步消息传递)，而这涉及到更复杂的科学和工程。

For such reasons, my claim is that a far better approach is to create a “Google style” team to develop the stack. The problem here is that if you really want to build a team of similar quality to the one Google had in the early days, you need to start with extremely strong authentic original science or you will not be able to attract the initial core team of superstar talent — they would easily see through white papers that are really ICO marketing documents, and of course beautiful technical designs where what the initial Google operation was built around, not marketing. Once you have meaningful novel science supported by such a team of superstars, you then need to add further layers of superstars to the team, in the form of an onion, where the quality of each new layer will determine the quality of later layers because superstars strongly prefer to join other superstars. This is a very, very difficult thing to do — especially in a rush — and in the blockchain industry would demand a combination of technical and entrepreneurial experience that is in short supply.

基于这些原因，我的主张是，一个更好的方法是创建一个“谷歌风格”的团队来开发堆栈。这里的问题是,如果你真的想建立一个团队的类似质量的谷歌在早期,你需要开始与极强的真实的原始科学或者你将无法吸引巨星的初始核心团队人才,他们会很容易地看到通过白皮书真正ICO营销文件,当然还有美丽的技术设计,最初的谷歌操作是建立在什么,不是销售。一旦你有意义的科学小说由这样一个超级明星,然后需要进一步添加层超级明星的团队,一个洋葱的形式,每一个新层的质量将决定后层的质量,因为明星强烈倾向于加入其他的超级明星。这是一件非常非常困难的事情——尤其是在匆忙中——在区块链的行业中，需要将技术和创业经验结合在一起。

The quantities of funds being raised helps to hide the problem from the masses. Tezos may have raised $350M in ICO funding after the rise in crypto prices but in their last update they have only just made their very first hire — a business development executive in San Francisco (when Tezos ran their ICO, their team page displayed software developers working at an OCaml company in France that had agreed to do some contractual work for them rather than their own full time employees). There are many questions yet to be answered: Is their initial technical work weighty enough to build a superstar core around? And, if it is — or alternatively they can somehow attract and enthuse talent using monumental salaries— will they be able to build out the team layer-by-layer and create the kind of culture they need to win the technology race?

筹集的资金数量有助于把问题从群众中隐藏起来。Tezos可能筹资350美元ICO资金密码价格上涨后但在最后更新他们才刚刚由第一个雇佣,在旧金山的一位业务拓展经理(当Tezos运行他们的图标,页面显示软件开发团队在一个OCaml公司工作在法国已经同意做一些合同为他们工作,而不是自己的全职员工)。还有很多问题有待回答:他们最初的技术工作是否足以打造一个超级明星核心?而且，如果它是——或者他们可以以某种方式吸引和热情地使用巨额薪酬——他们是否能够建立一个团队，并创造出他们需要赢得技术竞赛的那种文化?

Only time will tell whether they can, but it is certainly true that their path does not reflect the much more organic way incredible technical organizations such as Google have arisen and developed their systems in the past. While I genuinely wish the Tezos and EOS teams the very best of luck, I think they will have their work cut out making their ICO funds work for them whether they pursue Google or decentralized team models.

只有时间才能证明他们是否能做到，但他们的道路并没有反映出像谷歌这样令人难以置信的技术组织在过去的发展和发展。虽然我真诚地希望Tezos和EOS团队好运，但我认为他们将有他们的工作，让他们的ICO基金为他们工作，不管他们是追求谷歌还是分散的团队模型。
 
But again, the proof will be in the pudding — and of course I’m biased because I am strongly invested in the modus operandi of DFINITY where we put stellar team and science first, and mostly neglect chasing ICO money and press coverage. Our philosophy and claim is that we can win simply by launching a world-changing network in the form of a performant blockchain computer that has unbounded capacity upon which it is very easy to develop new applications and systems. Anyone interested in what we do should start by looking at our team page. If you are suitably impressed, you will also be interested to know we have many more HUGE hires in the pipeline that will rock the tech world. Superstars are now joining us in droves because of our authentic novel science and the team we already have. This is what real momentum looks like and what I think is truly necessary to accelerate the development of blockchain networks.

但同样的，证据也会出现在我的作品中——当然，我也有偏见，因为我对DFINITY的运作方式进行了强烈的投资，我们把一流的团队和科学放在第一位，而忽略了对ICO资金和媒体报道的追逐。我们的理念和主张是，我们可以简单地通过启动一个改变世界的网络，以一种具有无限容量的高性能区块链计算机的形式来获得胜利，这种计算机非常容易开发新的应用程序和系统。任何对我们的工作感兴趣的人都应该从我们的团队页面开始。如果你对此印象深刻的话，你也会有兴趣知道，我们还有更多的人才会在这条管线上雇佣更多的员工。现在，超级明星们纷纷加入我们的行列，因为我们真正的新科学和我们已经拥有的团队。这就是真正的动力，我认为真正需要的是加速区块链网络的发展。

For me personally my experience switching to the Google search engine back in the early 2000’s was defining. I remember being an “AltaVista head” until somebody told me to try out Google and I duly typed in http://google.com. I did a search and immediately saw how much better the results were and how much more quickly they were produced. Being an AltaVista head I nonetheless went back to AltaVista feeling faintly offended that my religion had been challenged. However I still became a full-time Google user within 2 days. DFINITY plans to win in a similar way and is obsessed about product/market fit, game changing technology, superstar science and engineering and culture. Given what our team is cooking, I expect the forthcoming release of the DFINITY network will ring major changes in the pace of blockchain advancement.

就我个人而言，我的经验是，在2000年初，我切换到谷歌的搜索引擎。我记得我是一个“AltaVista的头”，直到有人告诉我试试谷歌，然后我就在http://google.com上输入了。我做了一个搜索，并立即看到结果有多好，以及他们的生产速度有多快。作为一个AltaVista的领导者，我还是回到了AltaVista，我的宗教受到了挑战。然而，我还是在2天内成为了一个全职的谷歌用户。DFINITY计划以类似的方式赢得胜利，并痴迷于产品/市场适应、游戏改变技术、超级明星科学、工程和文化。考虑到我们团队正在做的事情，我预计即将发布的DFINITY网络将会对区块链升级的速度带来重大的改变。
