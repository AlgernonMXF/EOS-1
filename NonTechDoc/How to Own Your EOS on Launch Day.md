# Why Registering an EOS Public Key is Important.|为什么注册EOS公钥很重要

I’d like to speak to the importance of registering your ETH address, where you hold your current EOS tokens, to a public EOS key. You may have noticed the saying: “secure life, liberty, and property” crop up quite a bit in your EOS research. Registering a public key to your ETH address is doing just that, securing your property. This article will have cover a few points:

本文将讲述注册你EOS代币的ETH地址到到一个EOS公钥的重要性。你可能已经注意到一句不断出现在EOS研究文章中的名言:“安全的生活、自由和财产”。注册一个EOS公钥你的ETH地址即为实现这一目标，保护你的财产。本文将包括以下几部分:

Basics Reasons Not to Store on an Exchange

不把币存在交易所的根本原因

Difficulty of ERC20-EOS Token for Exchanges

ERC20-EOS代币的交易所困难

Launch Scenarios Involving Multiple Chains If You:

启动场景涉及多种链

     Hold EOS on an Exchange
     Hold EOS in an Unregistered Private Wallet
     Hold EOS in a Registered Wallet

# The Basics: “Not Your Keys, Not Your Tokens.” | 根本原因：“不是你的密钥，不是你的币”

This is blockchain and crypto 101. If you do not own the private keys to your tokens, you do not own them, PERIOD - storing tokens on an exchange can be bad news. If you are not an active trader, there is zero reason to not secure your property in a private wallet to which you own the key. The plethora of wallet options leaves no excuse for not taking control of your tokens. Currently, EOS is an ERC20 token, so creating a wallet can be as simple as installing the MetaMask browser extension, or as complex as setting up an offline wallet using the MEW software on a local machine. You decide for yourself which security system best suits your investment size and tech expertise.

这是区块链和加密货币的常识。如果你不拥有你的代币私钥，你就不拥有你的代币，把币放在交易所是一个坏消息。如果不是一个高频交易者，没有理由不使用你自己的钱包，保护你的财产安全。现在有很多的钱包选择，你没有理由不自己掌控你自己的代币。目前，EOS是一个ERC20代币，因此创建一个钱包可以像安装MetaMask浏览器扩展一样简单，或者也可以像在本地机器上使用MEW软件设置一个离线钱包一样复杂。你可以自己决定使用，哪种最适合你的投资规模和技术专长的钱包系统。

Below are some examples of exchanges hacks, scams and fraud that have occurred:

以下是一些交易所被黑或者欺骗的例子：

Some of the cases aren’t even nefarious, but things like Binance’s recent maintenance/upgrade locked people out of their system for 32.25 hours:

有些案例不是恶意的，但是像币安交易所最近的维护/升级，将币锁在了系统近32.25小时:

Hopefully this convinces you to not store tokens on an exchange! Now let’s talk about launch day and the possibility of multiple chains and what happens to the 3 different types of EOS holders.

希望这能说服您不要把币存在交易所。下面，我们谈谈EOS主网启动日，和多重链的可能性以及三种不同类型EOS持有者的情况。

# Difficulty of ERC20-EOS Token Conversion for Exchanges:|交易所ERC20-EOS代币转换的困难:

Before we get deep into the multiple chain scenario, let’s first mention that there will be some potential for exchanges to be apathetic about converting your ERC20 tokens into proper EOS even if there’s just one chain. There is no guarantee this launch will go smoothly, and your tokens will be forgotten or held in limbo for an unknown period.

在深入讨论多重链场景之前，首先要说明的是，即使只有一个链，交易所有也可能存在不能将ERC20代币转换成正确的EOS币的的可能性。这次主网启动不保证一定会顺利进行，你的代币将被遗忘，或者在某个时期处于未知状态。

# EOS Launch Day, Hypothetical Multi-Chain Scenario | EOS启动日，假设多链场景

I think it’s a very likely scenario that arises, multiple communities launch EOS blockchains using the genesis snapshot created by the EOS.io software. For the purposes of this, I will simply call them EOS1, EOS2, and EOS3. Also, the following exchange scenario I am simply using a generic exchange. I now dub it ACMEex

我认为这是一个很可能出现的情况，多个社区使用EOS创建的创始快照启动EOS区块链。为了达到这个目的，我将简单地称它们为EOS1、EOS2和EOS3。另外，下面的交换场景我只是使用通用交易所。我以ACMEex为例。

# Launch Day for the Exchange Hodler:

So, ERC20 tokens are now frozen, and you’ve given all agency and voting rights to a centralized organization, ACMEex, over which you have no control. First, you have to trust they will give you any EOS at all, but wait, there’s multiple EOS chains, which EOS will ACMEex give you? WIll they give you all 3? That answer can get complicated...

ERC20代币现在被冻结，您将所有的代理和投票权授予了一个中心化的组织ACMEex，您已没有控制权它。首先，你只能相信交易所会给你任何EOS，但是，有多个EOS链，EOS会给哪个?他们会全部给你吗?这个答案可能会变得很复杂……

Let’s say ACMEex runs a pretty decent campaign to be a block producer, yet fall short of the top 21 on EOS1 chain. ACMEex decides they want to round up some other large Asia based block producer candidates and create EOS2 to compete. Finally, some mid level block producer candidates decide to band together and create EOS3 but fail to gain wide adoption. Which token do you think ACMEex will feed you first? Well, EOS2, even if it ends up being a secondary public chain.They have a vested interest to try and make EOS2 the winner and take their spot in the top 21 block producer rotation. Will they eventually give you EOS1? Probably if I am being perfectly honest, but there is no guarantee. Will they give you EOS3 tokens to match your original stake in EOS? Highly unlikely. You’ve just missed out on accumulating and having say in two other EOS blockchains.

比方说，ACMEex参与了见证人的竞选，但却未能进入EOS1链的前21名。ACMEex决定，他们希望联合在其他一些大型的亚洲矿场，创建EOS2来竞争。最后，一些中等的见证候选人决定联合起来创建EOS3，但是没有得到广泛的同意。你认为ACMEex会先发给你什么?嗯，EOS2，即使它最终是一个二手公共链。他们有巨大的兴趣，努力让EOS2成为赢家，并在前21个区块的生产者轮换中占有一席之地。他们最终会给你EOS1吗?也许很诚实的话会，但是没有保证。他们会给你EOS3代币吗?极不可能。你只是错过这个多重领取，只能使用另外两个EOS区块链。

This doesn’t even account for the fallout that would happen if ACMEex voted your stake into both EOS1 and EOS2 in order to win a block producer position. Those tokens are locked in, and cannot be redistributed, save the trickling back schedule over 6 months. Does this sound like you have any sense of control in the EOS ecosystem? Your answer should be a resounding no.

如果ACMEex将你的代币投给EOS1和EOS2，后果将会无法预计。这些代币被锁定，不能重新分配，在6个月的时间内。这听起来像你在EOS生态系统中有任何掌控感吗?你的回答应该是响亮的“不”。

# Launch Day for the Private Hodler w/ Unregistered Wallet:| 如果启动日钱包没有注册

Things are much simpler but you give up some valuable rights and add complexity to recovering your property. You will eventually get tokens on all three chains; however, the process for actually logging in and broadcasting a transaction on the network will be mired in doubt for hours, days, weeks or longer. Block.one has hinted at, but not given any real workflows for this transition, and one option presented could mean exposing your ETH private key to claim the tokens. This opens you up to security flaws, and it gives you no say in the early days of a token you feel has promise. You will not get to participate in the initial block producer voting or potentially validate tokens on EOS2 and EOS3. No matter how it shakes out, those tokens are likely to have some value greater than zero and you will delay your access to them for an unknown amount of time.

事情要简单得多，但你放弃了一些有宝贵的权利，增加了财产恢复的复杂性。你最终会得到所有三个链上的虚拟币;然而，实际登录和在网络上广播交易的过程将会比较困难，可能长达数小时、几天、几周甚至更长时间。Block.one已经提示过，但是没有为这个转换提供任何实际的工作流程，而且一个种可能是，需要暴露您的ETH私钥来领取这些币。这可能存在在安全漏洞，在你代币的早期，你不会有任何行使权力的机会。您将无法参与初始的见证人投票，也不能在EOS2和EOS3上验证代币。不管结果如何，这些代币不会归零，只是将会延迟对它们的所有权，并且延迟的时间也有不确定性。

# Launch Day for the Private Hodler w/ Registered Wallet:| 如果启动日已注册钱包

(Photo: Artist’s rendering of a registered wallet hodler during launch.)

You wake up, grab a nice cup of coffee. You pull up your countdown to launch of what you consider to be EOS1 and you prepare to open your EOS wallet of choice. You prepare to type in your EOS public key and retrieve your EOS private key from the waterproof and fireproof storage method of choice. You start hunting and pecking away as you transcribe your private key to take ownership of your shiny new EOS tokens. You cast some votes for block producers on the EOS1 chain and you sit back to finish your coffee. By the time the cup is looking empty, you see a flurry of Twitter activity that ACMEex is launching a new chain because they did not like the outcome of block producer voting. Hmm, interesting, that could gain traction. You head back over to your new EOS wallet, and point it at the new EOS2 chain. You sign a transaction and you wait to see if EOS2 gains the 15% required for being a proper EOS public chain. Finally, you come back a bit later and see EOS3 emerge. Perhaps they’ve announced a major change to the expected governance model and will be honoring one account is one vote for block producers. Wow, that could really be in interesting use case, so you point your wallet at the chain and sign your transaction. It may or may not get to 15% acceptance, but it’s all a grand experiment.

你早上醒来，端起杯好咖啡。你开为主网EOS1的启动的倒计时，并打开你的EOS钱包。键入您的EOS公钥，并从选择的防水和防火存储中找出EOS私钥。输入你的私钥，开始搜索，获取属于你的崭新EOS币。你为EOS1链投上几张票，然后坐下来喝完咖啡。当咖啡要喝完时，你发现Twitter上正在卷起一场风暴，ACMEex正在推出一个新的链，因为他们不满意刚才见证人的投票结果。嗯，有意思，这可能会有吸引力。你回到你的新EOS钱包，并指向新的EOS2链。你做了签名，就等着看EOS2是否能获得作为EOS公链所需的15%。最后，你回来发现，又出现一个EOS3。他们已经宣布了对治理模式的重大改变，把见证人投票策略改为一个帐户一票。哇，这可能真的是一个有趣使用方法，所以你把你的钱包指到该链上并签名。它可能会也可能不会得到15%的认可，但这都是一个宏大的尝试。

Job done, now you sit back and let the chains figure out and fight for dominance. Either way, it doesn’t matter for a personal property standpoint, because you have stakes in them all and can even involve yourself in the early governance structures of these chains. The EOS2 and EOS3 chains will not likely share the same token value as EOS1, but there is a decent chance that their value is greater than zero. Congratulations, you just increased your holdings, secured your property and took the future in your own hands.

上述工作完成，你可以坐下来休息，让各个链去竞争。无论结果如何，从个人财产的角度来书都不重要，因为你已拥有他们所有的权益，甚至可以参与到这些链的早期治理结构中去。链EOS2和EOS3不大可能与EOS1共享相同的价值，但是它们的价值一般会大于零。恭喜你，你只是增加了你的财产，保护了你的财产，并掌握了自己的未来。

The difference between the final two hodlers in this scenario is approximately 15-20 clicks using the MEW interface, and perhaps less if you register through the token sale site. Ask yourself, do I care about securing my life, liberty and property? I hope after reading this you’ve come to the conclusion that yes, yes you do.

在此场景中，如果使用MEW接口大约需要15-20次点击，如果通过代币销售网站注册的话，可能会更少。问问你自己，我是否关心我的生命安全、自由和财产?我希望读完这篇文章后，你会得出这样的结论:是的，是的。
