Vitalik recently made claims that Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) results in rule by plutocracy (government by the wealthy). He then goes on to argue for governance by cryptoeconomics, the use of economic incentives and cryptography to govern.

Vitalik最近声称，股份授权证明（DPOS）导致富豪统治（富人政府）。然后，他继续主张通过使用经济激励和密码学治理方式的加密经济学进行治理。

My entire mission in life is based upon finding crypto-economic solutions for securing life, liberty, property, and justice for all. Vitalik and I are fundamentally striving for the same end goal: minimizing corruption and maximizing freedom in society. The primary difference between us are our fundamental assumptions.

我（BM）人生的全部使命都是找到基于加密经济的解决方案来保障生命、自由、财产和正义。 Vitalik和我正在从根本上努力实现同样的最终目标: 最大限度地减少腐败和最大限度地实现社会自由。 我们之间的主要区别是我们的基本假设。

There are three incontrovertible premise upon which I base my work:
1.The vast majority of people have good intentions
2.You cannot prove a negative
3.There is no such thing as a closed economic system

我的工作有三个不容置疑的前提：
1.绝大多数人都有好意
2.你不能证明一个行为是恶意的
3.世界上没有封闭的经济体系

Vitalik is looking for a cryptoeconomic blackbox that assumes you cannot rely voting whether by stake (plutocracy) or by individual (democracy). This blackbox needs to dispense candy for good inputs and electric shocks for bad inputs. The premise is that if we could only put the right algorithm inside the box then man can be free from rule of the wealthy. Vitalik is looking for the preverbal Dues ex Machina (God from the machine) to save mankind from its own tragic corruption.

Vitalik正在寻找一个假定既不能依靠股份（富豪政治）也不能依靠个人（民主）来进行投票的加密经济黑匣子，这个黑匣子靠分发奖励给好的输入，并惩治坏的输入。前提是，如果我们能把正确的算法放在盒子里, 那么人类就可以摆脱富人的统治。Vitalik正在寻找口头上的 Dues ex Machina (机器般的上帝：点击查看维基百科)以拯救人类免受源于自身的悲剧性腐败。

I, on the other hand, am looking to create tools to be used by competing groups of good people where at least 2/3 are honest. I believe people are fundamentally good. Let’s look at the practical reality. The more effective a group is at maintaining its integrity as it grows, the larger the group will grow. The more corrupt a group is the faster it will die. Creating tools for competition in the free market recognizes the reality of open economic systems which is the foundation of true decentralization.

而我希望创造一些工具, 供那些至少有2 / 3诚实的竞争对手群体使用。 我相信人性本善。 让我们看看实际情况， 一个团体在成长过程中“保持诚实”的效率越高，这个群体的规模就会越大，而越腐败, 就会死得越快。为自由市场的竞争创造工具，需要认识到开放经济体系的现实，这是真正实现分权化的基础。

##Blockchain as a Radio Station
## 区块链像一个无线电台

A blockchain can be viewed as a radio station that everyone in the world subscribes to and records. On this radio station anyone can broadcast cryptographic statements and everyone will process these statements via a deterministic state machine to arrive at consensus.

区块链可以被看作是一个无线电台，世界上每个人都可以订阅和记录。在这个电台上，任何人都可以播放加密声明，每个人都将通过一个确定状态的机器来处理这些声明, 以达成共识。

The challenge we all face is determining which radio stations we care about, who gets to broadcast, and when do they get to broadcast.

我们所有人都面临的挑战是我们到底关心哪些电台、谁在广播，以及什么时候广播。

Proof of Work systems as used by Bitcoin and Ethereum rely upon the loudest transmitter. Those with the most money have the power to broadcast over everyone else. Those without access to the physical resources to broadcast (power generation and transmission towers), must buy the air time from those with the resources. Furthermore, those with 51% of the transmitter power can jam those with 49%. This is rule by plutocracy.

BTC和ETH使用的工作量证明系统（POW）依赖于那些最大声的发射器，拥有最多钱的人有能力在其他人之前广播并以最大声广播，而那些无法获得物质资源（发电和传输塔）的人，就必须从拥有资源的人手中购买广播时间。另外那些拥有超过51%的发射功率的人可以干扰其他只有49%的人。这是由富豪统治的。

Proof of Stake systems give each person a percentage of the air time proportional to the amount of stake they have. This eliminates the need for a massive power station to override everyone else’s signal, but still requires you to have the ability to operate your transmitter 24/7 so it is ready to transmit when the time arrives. Those without the technological ability to operate a transmitter must buy airtime from those with ability. Those with 51% of the stake can ignore those with 49%. This is rule by plutocracy.

股份权益证明（POS系统）给予每个人按照其拥有的份额比例的广播时间。这样就限制了架设一个大型发射器覆盖他人信号的需求，但是仍然需要你有能力7*24h运行你的发射器。这样就可以在任何时候发送信号。那些没有技术能力操作发射机的人必须从有能力的人那里购买广播时间。 拥有51% 股份的投资者可以忽略那些拥有49% 股份的人。 这是由富豪统治的。那些没有能力操作发射器的人必须从有能力的人那里购买广播时间。拥有51%股份的人可以忽略那些拥有49％的股份的人。这也是由富豪统治的。

Delegated Proof of Stake systems give each stakeholder the power to vote for the people who control the transmitter. This voting process is also stake weighted, but due to the nature of approval voting simply having a large stake is not sufficient to guarantee you some control over the transmitter. You must have approval by the majority of the voting stake to have control over the transmitter, this is a significantly higher threshold of approval than pure proof of stake. Unlike, pure Proof of Stake, it is possible for the voters to create a system where airtime cannot be purchased, but where the elected transmitters are expected to give everyone their fair share of air-time based upon their stake.

DPOS（股份授权系统）的授权证明赋予每个利益相关者给控制发射器的人投票的权力。投票过程也是以股权权益的方式进行的，但是由于有投票的性质，仅仅只是拥有很大部分的股权并不能够保证对发射器的控制权。必须要获得大多数股份投票才能获得发射器控制权，这比纯粹的股权证明（POS）要高得多。与纯粹的股权证明（POS）不同，选民有可能创建一个无法购买广播时间的系统，但是当选的发射器会按照每个人的股份给予每个人公平的广播时间份额。

There is a clear separation between those with control of the transmitter and those with stake and no one gets monopoly power to charge bribes to use the transmitter. Attempts to take bribes (fees) will result in loss of community support and removal. Stakeholders who support the corrupt transmitters can also be removed from the community.

控制发射器的人和控制股份的人之间有明确的分离，没有人可以通过贿赂来获取垄断权力控制发射器。企图贿赂将会失去社区支持，支持腐败的利益相关者也可以从社区中剔除。

##Limits of Crypto-economic Governance
## 加密经济治理的局限性

Cryptography can only be used to prove logical consistency. It cannot be used to make subjective judgment calls, determine right or wrong, or even identify truth or falsehood (outside of consistency).

密码学只能用来证明逻辑一致性，而不能用来作出主观判断, 判断是非、甚至不能用来判断真实和虚假（在一致性之外）。

The goal of all consensus algorithms is to determine the order of events. Due to the limits of speed of light and space time, every person will see events in a unique order. Two events generated at the same absolute time will be perceived at two different times depending upon how far away they originated. This means that all consensus depends upon selecting certain people to testify to an order of events. These people can be the ones with the largest transmitters, the ones with the most stake, the ones with the most stake-weighted votes, or the ones with the most democratic votes. They could be a benevolent notary, a committee, or any other group that people can agree on.

所有共识算法的目标是确定事件的顺序，由于光、时间、空间的限制，每个人都会以独特的顺序看到事件。在相同的绝对时间产生的两个事件将在两个不同的时间被人感知到，这取决于离源头有多远。这就意味着所有共识都取决于选择某些人来证明事件的顺序。这些人可以是拥有最多发射器的人、有最多股份的人、或者拥有最多民主选票的人。他们可能是一位仁慈的公证人、一个委员会、或者任何人们可以达成共识的团体。

The one thing that cryptography will never be able to prove is censorship. You cannot objectively prove that someone received your message unless said person cooperates by generating a cryptographic proof. Therefore, you cannot punish them for failing to include your transaction using objective cryptographic proofs.

密码学无法证明的一件事就是审查制度。除非有人通过生成加密证明来进行合作，不然你不能客观地证明这个人收到了你的信息，因此，也就不能因使用客观加密证明未能包含你的交易信息而对他们进行惩罚。

This has HUGE implications for the design of Ethereum’s scaling solutions which rely upon cryptographic “challenge periods” during which “proof of bad behavior” can be submitted. The proof must first get approval of the radio transmitter or it will never be factored into consensus. If the radio transmitters are corrupt, then they can simply ignore the cryptographic evidence. Someone attempting to steal all the funds from a side-chain could simply bribe the transmitters with 50% of the take to censor a challenge proof. There would be no objective proof of the censorship and no way to slash the transmitters using crypto-economic means within the system.

这对以太坊缩放解决方案有着巨大的影响，而这些解决方案依赖于可以提交“不良行为证明”的加密“挑战期”。证明必须首先得到发射器端的认可，否则就永远都不会被考虑以达成共识。如果发射器端是腐败的，那么他们就可以简单地忽略密码学证据。如果有人试图从一个侧链窃取所有资金，就可以用50%的钱贿赂发射器端来审查“挑战证据”。 没有客观证据证明审查制度, 也没有办法在系统内使用密码经济手段来阻断该腐败的发射器。


##Reliance on Strong Artificial Intelligence
##依赖强大的人工智能

If you are unwilling to trust any group of people to make judgments over subjective matters, then that implies that you are relying on artificial intelligence. This intelligence needs to be programmed with some definition of “right” and “wrong” and that definition must be measurable. Unless the AI system is omniscient, it must derive its conclusions from the potentially byzantine subjective inputs of individuals.

如果你不信任任何一群人对主观问题作出判断，那就意味着你要依赖人工智能。这种情报需要用“正确”和“错误”的定义来编程，而且这个定义必须是可测量的。除非AI系统是无所不知的，否则它必须从个体可能错综复杂的主观输入中得出结论。

##No Closed Economic Systems
##没有封闭的经济体系

The heart of cryptoeconomics is the ability to impose an economic gain or loss on an individual based upon cryptographic evidence. For such a system to work it must have cryptographic proof of the an individual’s internal and external positions, an impossibility. For example, in bond-weighted voting the assumption is that a person will be truthful for fear of losing their bond. The reality is that it is not possible to “prove” the economic exposure of an individual because they might have more to gain or lose outside the system than inside.

密码经济学的核心是基于加密证据对个人施行经济奖励或惩罚的能力。要使这样一个制度发挥作用，就必须有个人内部和外部立场的加密证明，这是不可能的。例如，在债券加权投票中，假设一个人会因为害怕失去债券而诚实。现实情况是，根本不可能“证明”一个人披露出来的经济状况，因为在体制外，可能会比在体制内获得更多的收益或损失。

##Conclusion
##结论


Vitalik and I are both attempting to solve some very challenging problems in human governance. I have chosen to recognize certain realities regarding the limits of objective proofs and accept reality that each community might have its own definition of “right and wrong” which can only be measured by a poll of the subjective opinions of community members. The true goal is to lower the barrier to entry for the creation of new communities and allow free market competition to reward the most effective communities and punish the most corrupt.

Vitalik和我都试图解决人类治理中一些非常具有挑战性的问题。我选择承认某些关于客观证据范围的现实情况，并接受现实，即每个社区都可能有自己关于“对与错”的定义，只能通过对社区成员的主观意见进行投票来衡量。真正的目标是降低创建新社区的准入门槛，并允许自由市场奖励效率最高的社区、并惩罚最腐败的群体。

The only way to maintain the integrity of a community is for the community to have control over its own composition. This means that open-entry systems built around anonymous participation will have no means expelling bad actors and will eventually succumb to profit-driven corruption. You cannot use stake as a proxy for goodness whether that stake is held in a bond or a shareholder’s vote. Goodness is subjective and it is up to each community to define what values they hold as good and to actively expel people they hold has bad.

维持社区完整性的唯一方法是让社区控制自己的组成。这意味着，以匿名参与为基础的开放式进入系统将无法驱逐不良行为者，最终会屈从于利润驱动的腐败。不管是以债券或股东的投票方式持有, 你都不能用股份来替代“善良”。善良是主观的, 每个社区应该定义他们认为什么样的价值观是好的，并积极驱逐他们认为的坏人。

The community I want to participate in will expel the rent-seeking vote-buyers and reward those who use their elected broadcasting power for the benefit of all community members rather than special interest groups (such as vote-buyers). I have faith that such a community will be far more competitive in a market competition for mindshare than one that elects vote buyers.

我期望参与的社区将驱逐那些寻租投票的人，并奖励那些利用自己投票权选举产生为所有社区成员谋福利的人，而不是特殊利益集团(例如投票者)。我相信，这样的社区在自由市场的竞争力将远远超过贿选者的竞争力。
